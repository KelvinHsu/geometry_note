\begin{theorem}(Isoperimetric Inequality)
	For any simple closed curve, one has \[4\pi L \leq L^2\], where $L$ denotes the length of the curve and $A$ the area enclosed, with the equality $\iff$ $C$ is a circle.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof} We will provide two versions of proofs: the first is more an illustration than a proof, yet rather interesting, while the second is a modern rigorous proof employing the Wrintinger's inequality (1-dimensional special case of Poincar\'e's lemma).

\end{proof}
